# STM32_SmartBus
Realize data interaction between hardware and Alibaba Cloud platform through STM32, 4G, and MQTT protocols
通过STM32、4G和MQTT协议实现硬件与阿里云平台之间的数据交互


# 说明
我知道这个系统还存在很多缺陷，比如裸机开发，代码逻辑不够清晰，而且繁琐。而且MQTT质量低，容易丢包。还有一些硬件选材不够合适，造成资源浪费。
恳请各位大佬提出意见，甚至可以一起完善这个项目，谢谢！  
I know that this system still has many flaws, such as bare metal development, the code logic is not clear enough, and cumbersome. Moreover, the quality of MQTT is low and packets are easily lost. In addition, some hardware materials are not suitable enough, causing a waste of resources.
I sincerely ask you all for your opinions, and you can even improve this project together, thank you!
